    """Create Phonopy instance from parameters and/or input files.

    "phonopy_yaml"-like file is parsed unless crystal structure information is
    given by unitcell_filename, supercell_filename, unitcell
    (PhonopyAtoms-like), or supercell (PhonopyAtoms-like). Even when
    "phonopy_yaml"-like file is parse, parameters except for crystal structure
    can be overwritten.

    Phonopy default files of 'FORCE_SETS' and 'BORN' are parsed when they are
    found in current directory and those data are not yet provided by other
    means.

    Crystal structure
    -----------------
    Means to provide crystal structure(s) and their priority:
        1. unitcell_filename (with supercell_matrix)
        2. supercell_filename
        3. unitcell (with supercell_matrix)
        4. supercell.
        5. phonopy_yaml

    Force sets or force constants
    -----------------------------
    Optional. Means to provide information to generate force constants and their
    priority:
        1. force_constants_filename
        2. force_sets_filename
        3. phonopy_yaml if force constants are found in phonoy_yaml.
        4. phonopy_yaml if forces are found in phonoy_yaml.dataset.
        5. 'FORCE_CONSTANTS' is searched in current directory.
        6. 'force_constants.hdf5' is searched in current directory.
        7. 'FORCE_SETS' is searched in current directory.
    When both of 3 and 4 are satisfied but not others, force constants and
    dataset are stored in Phonopy instance, but force constants are not produced
    from dataset.

    Parameters for non-analytical term correctiion (NAC)
    ----------------------------------------------------
    Optional. Means to provide NAC parameters and their priority:
        1. born_filename
        2. nac_params
        3. phonopy_yaml.nac_params if existed and is_nac=True.
        4. 'BORN' is searched in current directory when is_nac=True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phonopy_yaml : str, bytes, os.PathLike, io.IOBase, optional
        Filename of "phonopy.yaml"-like file for str or bytes, otherwise file
        pointer-like. If this is given, the data in the file are parsed. Default
        is None.
    supercell_matrix : array_like, optional
        Supercell matrix multiplied to input cell basis vectors. shape=(3, ) or
        (3, 3), where the former is considered a diagonal matrix. Default is the
        unit matrix. dtype=int
    primitive_matrix : array_like or str, optional
        Primitive matrix multiplied to input cell basis vectors. Default is
        None, which is equivalent to 'auto'. For array_like, shape=(3, 3),
        dtype=float. When 'F', 'I', 'A', 'C', or 'R' is given instead of a 3x3
        matrix, the primitive matrix for the character found at
        https://spglib.github.io/spglib/definition.html is used.
    is_nac : bool, optional
        If True, look for 'BORN' file. If False, NAS is turned off. Default is
        True.
    calculator : str, optional.
        Calculator used for computing forces. This is used to switch the set of
        physical units. Default is None, which is equivalent to "vasp".
    unitcell : PhonopyAtoms, optional
        Input unit cell. Default is None.
    supercell : PhonopyAtoms, optional
        Input supercell. With given, default value of primitive_matrix is set to
        'auto' (can be overwitten). supercell_matrix is ignored. Default is
        None.
    nac_params : dict, optional
        Parameters required for non-analytical term correction. Default is None.
        {'born': Born effective charges
                 (array_like, shape=(primitive cell atoms, 3, 3), dtype=float),
         'dielectric': Dielectric constant matrix
                       (array_like, shape=(3, 3), dtype=float),
         'factor': unit conversion facotr (float)}
    unitcell_filename : str, optional
        Input unit cell filename. Default is None.
    supercell_filename : str, optional
        Input supercell filename. When this is specified, supercell_matrix is
        ignored. Default is None.
    born_filename : str, optional
        Filename corresponding to 'BORN', a file contains non-analytical term
        correction parameters.
    force_sets_filename : str, optional
        Filename of a file corresponding to 'FORCE_SETS', a file contains sets
        of forces and displacements. Default is None.
    force_constants_filename : str, optional
        Filename of a file corresponding to 'FORCE_CONSTANTS' or
        'force_constants.hdf5', a file contains force constants. Default is
        None.
    fc_calculator : str, optional
        Force constants calculator. Currently only 'alm'. Default is None.
    fc_calculator_options : str, optional
        Optional parameters that are passed to the external fc-calculator. This
        is given as one text string. How to parse this depends on the
        fc-calculator. For alm, each parameter is splitted by comma ',', and
        each set of key and value pair is written in 'key = value'.
    factor : float, optional
        Phonon frequency unit conversion factor. Unless specified, default unit
        conversion factor for each calculator is used.
    produce_fc : bool, optional
        Setting False, force constants are not calculated from dataset of
        displacements and forces even if the dataset exists. Default is True.
    is_symmetry : bool, optional
        Setting False, crystal symmetry except for lattice translation is not
        considered. Default is True.
    symmetrize_fc : bool, optional
        Setting False, force constants are not symmetrized when creating force
        constants from displacements and forces. Default is True.
    is_compact_fc : bool, optional
        Force constants are produced in the array whose shape is
            True: (primitive, supecell, 3, 3) False: (supercell, supecell, 3, 3)
        where 'supercell' and 'primitive' indicate number of atoms in these
        cells. Default is True.
    use_pypolymlp : bool, optional
        Use pypolymlp for generating force constants. Default is False.
    mlp_params : dict, optional
        A set of parameters used by machine learning potentials.
    store_dense_svecs : bool, optional
        Deprected. Dataset of shortest vectors between atoms in primitive
        cell and supercell is stored in the dense format when this is True.
        Default is True. In phonopy v3 or later version, False will not be
        supported.
    use_SNF_supercell : bool, optional
        Supercell is built by SNF algorithm when True. Default is False. SNF
        algorithm is faster than the original one, but the order of atoms in the
        supercell can be different from the original one. So the backward
        compatibility to the old data (e.g., force constants) may not be
        preserved.
    symprec : float, optional
        Tolerance used to find crystal symmetry. Default is 1e-5.
    log_level : int, optional
        Verbosity control. Default is 0.
