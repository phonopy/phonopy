    """Calculation of a phonon unfolding method.

    Implementation of an unfolding method by
    P. B. Allen et al., Phys. Rev. B 87, 085322 (2013)

    T(r_i) in this implementation is defined as

        T(r_i) f(x) = f(x - r_i).

    The sign is opposite from that written in the Allen's paper.
    Bloch wave is defined in the same way for phase convention

        Psi_k(x + r) = exp(ikr) Psi_k(x).

    By these, sign of phase in Eq.(3) (Eq.(7) as well) is opposite.

    Vacancies are treated as atomic sites where no atoms exist.
    Interstitials are treated as atomic sites with the interstitial
    atoms in a specific virtual primitive cell, but the respective
    atomic sites in the other virtual
    primitive cells are set as vacancies.

    The unfolded band structure may be plotted as
        x (wave vector): qpoints
        y (frequency): frequencies
        z (intencity) : unfolding_weights
