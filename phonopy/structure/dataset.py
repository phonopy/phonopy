    This is used to extract displacements and forces from displacement dataset.
    This method is considered more-or-less as a converter when the input is in
    type-1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    disp_dataset : dict
        Displacement dataset either in type-1 or type-2.

    Returns
    -------
    displacements : ndarray
        Displacements of all atoms in all supercells.
        shape=(snapshots, supercell atoms, 3), dtype='double', order='C'
    forces : ndarray or None
        Forces of all atoms in all supercells.
        shape=(snapshots, supercell atoms, 3), dtype='double', order='C'
        None is returned when forces don't exist.
