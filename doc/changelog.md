  - matplotlib >= 2.0

- For developers, flake8, black, pydocstyle, and isort were introduced. See
  `REAEME.md` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## Jul-8-2021: Version 2.11.0

- Maintenance release. C-methods were changed to use dense shortest vectors
  (`Primitive.get_smallest_vectors()`) format. But the front end still uses
  current format `shape=(size_super, size_prim, 27, 3)`.

## Jun-10-2021: Version 2.10.0

- Fix the contents of `entropy-volume.dat` and `Cv-volume.dat` in QHA were
  swapped. (Issue #144 by @prnvrvs)

  handled by the package manager.
- A new way of using phonopy from command line is proposed at
  {ref}`phonopy_load_command`.
- Castep interface was added by @ladyteam.

- CP2K interface is provided by Tiziano MÃ¼ller.
- Many minor bug fixes and updates.

## Sep-1-2019: Version 2.3.2

- It was forgotten to increment version number at v2.3.1. Now it is made to be
  v2.3.2 just for incrementing the number.

## Aug-29-2019: Version 2.3.1

- Fix alm wrapper to follow the lastest basis vector matrix form.

## Aug-29-2019: Version 2.3.0

- New setting tag {ref}`fc_calculator_tag` was implemented. With this, an
  external force constants calculator can be used. Currently only ALM
  (`FC_CALCULATOR = alm` or `--alm` option) is supported. By using ALM, we can
  compute force constants with any number of displacements in each supercell.
  Any number of supercells with displacements can be also handled with it if
  ordinary least square fitting can be solved for force constants.
  {ref}`random_displacements_tag` and {ref}`random_seed_tag` were implemented to
  use with ALM.
- For the external force constants calculator, new file format of `FORCE_SETS`
  was introduced. See {ref}`file_forces_type_2` `FORCE_SETS` format.

## Jul-21-2019: Version 2.2.0

- Collection of minor updates.
- Spglib update to v1.13.0.

## Jun-19-2019: Version 2.1.4

- [Bug fix](https://github.com/atztogo/phonopy/pull/96) of
  `Cp-temperature_polyfit.dat` calculation in QHA (by `@ezanardi`).

## Apr-17-2019: Version 2.1.3

- TURBOMOLE interface is provided by Antti Karttunen (`--turbomole`).

## Mar-24-2019: Version 2.1.2

- `PDOS = AUTO` (`--pdos="auto"`) was implemented.

## Feb-27-2019: Version 2.1.1

- User interface bug fix release.

## Feb-26-2019: Version 2.1

- Spglib update to v1.12.1.
- (Experimental) `phonopy` command accepts `phonopy.yaml` type file as an input
  crystal structure by `-c` option. When `DIM` and any structure file are not
  given, `phonopy_disp.yaml` (primary) or `phonopy.yaml` (secondary) is searched
  in the current directory. Then `phonopy.yaml` type file is used as the input,
  semi-automatic phonopy mode is invoked, which means:

  (1) `supercell_matrix` in the `phonopy.yaml` type file is used if it exists.
  (2) `primitive_matrix` in the `phonopy.yaml` type file is used if it exists.
  Otherwise, set `PRIMITIVE_AXES = AUTO` when `PRIMITIVE_AXES` is not given. (3)
  NAC params are read (`NAC = .TRUE.`) if NAC params are contained (primary) in
  the `phonopy.yaml` type file or if `BORN` file exists in the current directory
  (secondary). (4) Forces and displacements are read from the `phonopy.yaml`
  type file if those exist instead of reading `FORCE_SETS` in the current
  directory. (5) Calculator name (such as `qe`) is read if it is contained in
  the `phonopy.yaml` type file.

  Possible usages are:

  - For PhononDB at Kyoto-U
    (http://phonondb.mtl.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ph20180417/index.html) raw data, phonons
    are easily calculated, e.g., by
    `% phonopy -c phonon.yaml --band auto --mesh 100 -p`.
  - If `phonopy_params.yaml` is created using API of `phonopy.save()`
    ({ref}`phonopy_save_parameters`), phonopy's essential data may be easily
    passed to other people only by this file.
  - `phonopy_disp.yaml` is used instead of calculator option and input structure
    file. For example `--qe -c NaCl.in` is replaced by `-c phonopy_disp.yaml`.

## Jan-16-2019: Version 2.0

- `disp.yaml` is replaced by `phonopy_disp.yaml`. For the backward
  compatibility, when `phonopy_disp.yaml` is not found, `disp.yaml` is used.
- New calculator interface for DFTB+ written by Ben Hourahine.
- Minor update of the look of band structure plot. The format in `band.yaml` for
  treating labels was changed.
- `MESH` accepts a length value, which works in the same way as VASP automatic
  k-mesh generation (see {ref}`mp_tag`).
- For plotting DOS, it is changed to choose linear tetrahedron method as
  default, but not smearing method.
- Output file name of projected DOS was renamed from `partial_dos.dat` to
  `projected_dos.dat`.

## Nov-22-2018: Version 1.14.2

- This is the release for preparing features for future and is not well tested.
- Code refactoring to ease the development of calculator interface. Most of
  calculator interface dependent codes are moved to
  `phonopy.interface.__init__.py`.
- For eary adaptors, two experimental features were made:

  - Convenient Phonopy instance loader and crystal structure yaml parser
    (`phonopy.load()` and `phonopy.read_cell_yaml()`).
  - Automatic band paths generation using SeeKpath
    (https://seekpath.readthedocs.io/) (`BAND = AUTO`). Installation of SeekPath
    is needed.

## Nov-17-2018: Version 1.14.0

- From this version, a trial to follow Semantic Versioning starts.
- Automatic determination of transformation matrix from the input unit cell to
  the primitive is implemented (`PRIMITIVE_AXES = AUTO` or `--pa='auto'`).
- Spglib update to v1.11.1.
- Experimental support for dynamical structure factor
  ({ref}`dynamic_structure_factor`).
- Experimental support in phonopy-QHA for temperature dependent energy input
  ({ref}`--efe <phonopy_qha_efe_option>` option) from a file. To create this
  input file for a simple electron free energy was made for VASP
  (`phonopy-vasp-efe`).

## Jun-20-2018: Version 1.13.2

- `FULL_FORCE_CONSTANTS` tag is created ({ref}`full_force_constants_tag`).
- Minor update of script to use QE's `q2r.x` output ({ref}`this <qe_q2r>`).
- Updates and fixes of CRYSTAL and SIESTA interfaces.
- Updates of labels of irreducible representations of crystallographic point
  groups.

## Apr-21-2018: Version 1.13.0

- Non-analytical term correction by Gonze _et al._ ({ref}`reference_dp_dp_NAC`)
  is implemented and now this is the default NAC method. The former default
  method by Wang _et al._ ({ref}`reference_wang_NAC`) can be invoked by using
  `NAC_METHOD` tag ({ref}`nac_method_tag`).

## Jan-31-2018: Version 1.12.6

- Force constants file formats of `FORCE_CONSTANTS` and `force_constants.hdf5`
  are extended to support smaller size force constants. Backward compatibility
  is preserved. See {ref}`file_force_constants`. To write out force constants,
  the compact format is chosen as the default for usual cases.
- Performance improvement of phonopy and spglib by Michael Lamparski which is
  effective especially for larger unit cell systems.

## Jan-7-2018: Version 1.12.4

- For thermal displacements (and its matrices), `FMIN` (`--fmin`) and `FMAX`
  (`--fmax`) can be used to limit phonons included to the summation as the
  minimum and maximum frequencies, respectively. Instead, `CUTOFF_FREQUENCY`
  (`--cutoff-freq`) does not work for thermal displacements.
- The way of symmetrization for translation invariance is modified. As a result,
  `FC_SYMMETRY` became a Boolean, i.e., `FC_SYMMETRY = .TRUE.`
  (`--fc-symmetry`), and no need to specify a number.
- Experimental support to parse Quantum ESPRESSO `q2r.x` output from python
  script.

## Nov-8-2017: Version 1.12.2

- Command option parser of the phonopy tools is replaced from `optparse` to
  `argparse`.
- The behaviours of `-f`, `--fz`, and `--fc` options are slightly changed. The
  filenames used with these options were the positional arguments previously.
  Now they are the command-line arguments, i.e., filenames have to be put just
  after the option name like `-f vasprun.xml-001 vasprun.xml-002 ...`.
- New tags (options), `FC_FORMAT` (`--fc-format`), `READFC_FORMAT`
  (`read-fc-format`), `WRITEFC_FORMAT` (`write-fc-format`), `BAND_FORMAT`
  (`--band-format`), `MESH_FORMAT` (`--mesh-format`), and `QPOINTS_FORMAT`
  (`--qpoints-format`) were implemented. `HDF5` tag is deprecated.
- New tags `READ_FORCE_CONSTANTS` and `WRITE_FORCE_CONSTANTS` were made. They
  are equivalent to existing options of `--readfc` and `--writefc`. Using them,
  reading and writing force constants are separably controlled.

## Oct-19-2017: Version 1.12.0

- The names of auxiliary tools and `gruneisen` are changed, for which the prefix
  `phonopy-` is added to the old names to avoid accidental conflict with other
  filenames already existing under `bin`. `outcar-born` is renamed to
  `phonopy-vasp-born`. Similarly `gruneisen` is renamed `phonopy-gruneisen`.
  Please find these changes at {ref}`auxiliary_tools` and
  {ref}`phonopy_gruneisen`.

## Oct-2-2017: Version 1.11.14

- 6/m and 1 point groups are added for irreps dataset.
- `band.hdf5` is output instead of `band.yaml` when using `--hdf5` option
  together.
- Spglib update to v1.9.10. By this, symmetry search for supercells with large
  number of dimensions may become significantly faster.
- It is changed so that `mesh.yaml` or `mesh.hdf5` is not written out in thermal
  displacements calculations (`TDISP`, `TDISPMAT`, `TDISPMAT_CIF`). This is done
  to reduce the memory consumption of this calculation with dense mesh sampling.
- And many minor updates.

## June-18-2017: Version 1.11.12

- Maintenance release with many minor fixes after v1.11.10.

  phonopy.
- In Phonopy-API, from this version, to create displacements in supercells
  internally the phonopy object, the `generate_displacements` method has to be
  called explicitly along with the `distance` argument. See
  {ref}`phonopy_module`.

## Jul-17-2016: Version 1.10.10

- {ref}`dos_moment_tag` tags are implemented to calculate phonon moments.
- `qpoints.hdf5` is written with the `--hdf5` option. Dynamical matrices are
  also stored in `qpoints.hdf5` with `WRITEDM = .TRUE.` (`--writedm` option).

- Spglib update.

## Jan-4-2015: Version 1.9.2

- Behaviors of `--wien2k`, `--abinit`, `--pwscf` options have been changed. Now
  they are just to invoke those calculator modes without a unit cell structure
  file. The unit cell structure file is specified using `--cell` (`-c`) option
  or `CELL_FILENAME` tag. See {ref}`force_calculators`, {ref}`wien2k_interface`,
  {ref}`abinit_interface`, and {ref}`qe_interface`.
- For the `gruneisen` command, `--factor`, `--nomeshsym`, `--wien2k`,
  `--abinit`, and `--pwscf` options are implemented. See
  {ref}`gruneisen_calculators` and {ref}`gruneisen_command_options`.
- In phonopy-API, timing to call `Phonopy.set_dynamical_matrix` is changed to
  reduce the number of calls of this function. This may raise timing issue to
  phonopy-API users.
- Band-DOS (band-PDOS) plot is implemented.

## Oct-30-2014: Version 1.9.1.3

- Improve the speed to create supercell.
- Many minor changes to clean-up code badly written.

## Aug-28-2014: Version 1.9.0

- Use a native cElementTree of Python as VASP XML parser and stop using lxml.
  The native cElementTree is built in after Python 2.5. So Python 2.4 or before
  will not be supported from this phonopy version. This migration to
  cElementTree was made by shyuep.

## Aug-12-2014: Version 1.8.5

- Supercell creation behavior may change due to the change of algorithm. Though
  it used its own independent routine, now it uses the `Supercell` class to
  build supercell
- Spglib update (1.6.1-alpha)
- Experimental option `--fc_computation_algorithm="regression"` to compute force
  constants from forces and displacements using linear regression with
  displaying standard deviation, by KL(m).

## June-23-2014: Version 1.8.4.2

- Symmetrization of Born effective charge of `outcar-born` is improved.

  set.
- Bug fix to include cutoff frequency to the displacement distance matrix.
- Yaml output formats for band, mesh, q-points, modulation modes were slightly
  modified.
- Bug fix in finding equivalent atoms in supercell that has lower symmetry than
  the original unit cell.

## Apr-5-2014: Version 1.8.4.1

- Fix irreps for non-zero q-point of nonsymmorphic case

## Mar-31-2014: Version 1.8.4

- Implementation of analytical derivative of dynamical matrix in C, which
  improves the performance of group velocity calculation.
- Minor change of python module for group velocity.

## Feb-17-2014: Version 1.8.3

- A collection of small fixes in interface.
- Spglib update (spglib-1.6.0)
- Change in `phonopy/file_IO/write_FORCE_SETS_*`.

## Feb-8-2014: Version 1.8.2

- `vasprun.xml` of VASP 5.2.8 is only specially parsed to treat special wrong
  character.
- Python module interface is updated and modified. `set_post_process`,
  `set_force_sets` will be obsolete. `set_displacements` is obsolete.

## Jan-9-2014: Version 1.8.0

This version is dangerous. A lot of code is modified internally.

- Tetrahedron method is implemented for total and partial DOS. This is activated
  by `--thm` option.
- The display output with `-v` option is enriched.
- Symmetrization for `outcar-born` is implemented (Experimental).
- Cutoff-frequency `CUTOFF_FREQUENCY` (`--cutoff_freq`) is implemented to ignore
  frequencies lower than this cutoff frequency to calculate thermal properties
  and thermal displacements.

## Dec-4-2013: Version 1.7.5

- `--mass` option is created to shortcut of the `MASS` tag.
- `--fc_spg_symmetry` option is created to symmetrize force constants.
- Symmetry finder update (spglib version 1.5.2)

## Oct-3-2013: Version 1.7.4

- Thermal displacement matrix is implemented. See
  {ref}`thermal_displacement_matrices_tag` and {ref}`thermal_displacement`.
- PDOS with projection along arbitrary direction was implemented. See
  {ref}`projection_direction_tag`.
- `partial_dos.dat` format was changed. XYZ projected PDOS is not output.
  Instead atom projected PDOS (sum of XYZ projected PDOS) is written. See
  {ref}`output_files`.
- DOS and PDOS python interface was modified. The keyword of `omega_something`
  is changed to `freq_something`.
- `gruneisen` didn't run because it didn't follow the move of the `file_IO.py`
  file location. This is fixed.
- The formula of non-analytical term correction implemented in phonopy is not
  translational invariant in reciprocal space. This induces tiny difference of
  the choice of equivalent q-points being different by reciprocal primitive
  vectors. Now in the mesh sampling mode (`MP`), q-points are automatically
  moved to inside first-Brillouin-zone.
- In the mesh sampling mode, consistency of symmetry of mesh numbers to crystal
  symmetry is checked. If the symmetry disagrees with crystal symmetry, mesh
  symmetrization (equivalent to `MESH_SYMMETRY = .FALSE.`) is disabled.
- Wien2k interface is updated to adapt Wien2k-13.
- Fix the problem that only Vinet EOS worked in phonopy-qha.

## Sep-17-2013: Version 1.7.3

- Fix. Segmentation fault happens in some specific systems (e.g. Kubuntu 12.04
  32bit) due to a different behavior of numpy array creation.
- Group velocity for degenerate phonon mode is calculated slightly different
  from older version and now it is symmetrized by site-symmetry of q-point.

## Aug-4-2013: Version 1.7.2

- `group_velocity/__init__.py` is moved to `phonon` directory.
- `hphonopy/file_IO.py` is moved to top directory.
- New `harmonic/derivative_dynmat.py`: Analytical derivatives of dynamical
  matrix
- Group velocity is computed by analytical derivatives of dynamical matrix in
  the default configuration instead of previous finite difference method. Group
  velocity calculation with the finite difference method can be still activated

- Big phonopy-interface change was imposed. Some of filenames and formats of
  input and output files are modified. **There is no default setting filename**
  like `INPHON` (setting file is passed as the first argument). Some of tag
  names and those usage are also modified. Please first check
  {ref}`examples_link` for the new usage.

  List of changes:

  - Setting file has to be passed to phonopy as the first argument.
  - FORCES is replaced by FORCE_SETS ({ref}`file_forces`).

    ({ref}`band_structure_related_tags`).
  - DOS tag is renamed to DOS_RANGE tag ({ref}`dos_related_tags`).

  These changes are applied only for the phonopy interface. Internal simulation
  code has not been touched, so **physical results would not be affected**. If
  you have any questions, please send e-mail to phonopy {ref}`mailinglist`.

  `cells.py`. When :math:`M_s^{-1}M_p` is not symmetric, the supercell was not
  created correctly.

- `phonopy-FHI-aims` update by jm.

## Aug-24-2010: Version 0.9.1.3

- Update symmetry finder of spglib. Now precision is in Cartesian distance.

## June-10-2010: Version 0.9.1.2

- The code on non-analytical term correction is included in the
  `DynamicalMatrix` class. Data sets read by `parse_BORN` are set by
  `set_non_analytical_term` and gotten by `get_non_analytical_term`. The
  q-vector direction (only direction is used in the non-analytical term
  correction) is set by `set_q_non_analytical_term`. However for emprical
  damping function, some distance is used, i.e., when a q-point is getting away,
  non-analytical term is weaken. For this purpose, the second argument of
  `set_q_non_analytical_term` is used.

  At the same time, a small problem on the previous implementation was found.
  When a reduced q-point is out of the first Brillouin zone, it is not correctly
  handled. Currently it is fixed so as that when absolute values of elements of
  the reduced q-point are over 0.5, they are reduced into -0.5 < q < 0.5.

  [**Attention**] The previous `--nac` option is moved to `--nac_old`. `--nac`
  is used for different method of the non-analytical term correction at general
  q-points. This will be documented soon.

- Bug fix on `write_FORCES` in `file_IO.py`. When order of displacements in
  `DISP` file is not ascending order of atom indices, it was not correctly
  re-ordered. Because the default order of phonopy is ascending order, usually
  there is no problem for the most users.

- `phonopy-FHI-aims`

  - adapted to extensions of dynamical_matrix with respect to non-analytical
    corrections
  - added support for animation infrastructure
  - moved several options to control.in
