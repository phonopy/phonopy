TURBOMOLE & phonopy calculation
=========================================

Supported features
---------------------------

The ``riper`` module of TURBOMOLE can be used to study periodic structures.
The TURBOMOLE interface reads the unit cell from TURBOMOLE input files.
Lattice vectors and the name of the coordinate file are read from the ``control`` file.
Atomic symbols and Cartesian coordinates are read from the coordinate file.

How to run
----------

The workflow for a TURBOMOLE-Phonopy calculation is outlined here using the
Si example found in ``example/Si-TURBOMOLE``.

In this example, the TURBOMOLE input files are ``control`` and ``coord``.
This is the default for the TURBOMOLE interface and therefore the ``-c control``
parameter is not needed.

1) Create supercells with :ref:`turbomole_mode` option::

     % phonopy --turbomole --dim="3 3 3" -d

   In this example, the Si crystal structure is defined with the conventional
   unit cell of eight atoms and 3x3x3 supercells are created. For every supercell, the
   interface creates a subdirectory with ``control`` and ``coord`` files.
   Files in ``supercell`` contain the perfect supercell. The files in
   ``supercell-xxx`` (``xxx`` are numbers) contain the supercells with displacements.
   File ``phonopy_disp.yaml`` is also generated, containing information about the
   supercell and the displacements.

   In the case of the Si example, subdirectory ``supercell-001`` will be created.

2) Complete TURBOMOLE inputs need to be prepared manually in the subdirectories.

   Note that supercells with displacements must not be relaxed, because the
   atomic forces induced by a small atomic displacement are what we need for
   phonon calculation. To get accurate forces, $scfconv should be at least 10.
   Phonopy includes this data group  automatically in the control file.
   You also need to choose a k-point mesh for the force calculations.
   TURBOMOLE data group $riper may need to be adjusted to improve SCF convergence
   (see example files in subdirectory ``supercell-001`` for further details)

   Then, TURBOMOLE supercell calculations are executed to obtain forces on
   atoms, e.g., as follows::

     % riper > supercell-001.out

3) To create ``FORCE_SETS`` file required by Phonopy,
   the following command is executed::

     % phonopy --turbomole -f supercell-*

   Here ``supercell-*`` directories contain the TURBOMOLE output files
   from the force calculations (only the file ``gradient`` is required).
   To run this command, ``phonopy_disp.yaml`` has to be located in the current
   directory because the information on atomic displacements stored in
   this file are used to generate ``FORCE_SETS``. See some more
   detail at :ref:`turbomole_force_sets_option`.

4) Now, Phonopy post-prcessing commands can be run. ``FORCE_SETS`` is
   automatically read in. Note that here PRIMITIVE_AXES is defined in
   band.conf to create the phonon dispersions for the primitive cell.

   Create phonon dispersion plot with:

   ::

     % phonopy --turbomole --dim="3 3 3" -p -s band.conf
