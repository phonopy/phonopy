## A short history of phonopy

Phonopy development started to replace and extend fropho
(http://fropho.sourceforge.net/). The implementation of fropho is also based on
{ref}`reference_plk`. Although fropho was implemented from scratch except for
the symmetry finder and input file parser, to start the development, it was
motivated by the existence of PHON code. The important part of the
implementation is the symmetry handling. In fropho, at first the symmetry finder
in Abinit code was employed, but later the symmetry finder was replaced by
spglib (https://spglib.github.io/spglib/).
