This is the README file for NaCl phonon calculation with Wien2k output files.
The supercell structures are made by

% phonopy --wien2k -c NaCl.struct -d --dim="2 2 2"

This is also done for restoring disp.yaml that is used in the next step.
FORCE_SETS is obtained by

% phonopy --wien2k -f NaCl-001.scf NaCl-002.scf

Phonon analysis is done such as

% phonopy --wien2k -c NaCl.struct -p band.conf
