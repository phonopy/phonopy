To create supercell(s) with displacement(s):

% phonopy -d --dim 2 2 2 --pa auto -c POSCAR-unitcell

For this example, only one displaced supercell is made. Running VASP with this displaced supercell, vasprun.xml is obtained. To create FORCE_SETS that is the phonopy's default dataset to calculate force constants by

% phonopy -f vasprun.xml

To draw DOS,

% phonopy -p mesh.conf

To calculate thermal properties

% phonopy -p -t mesh.conf
