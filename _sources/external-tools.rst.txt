External tools
===============

Here external tools related to phonopy but supported by the groups out
of the phonopy project are listed.

Each of the tools is not supported by the phonopy project because of
the difficulties of the maintainance and the test by main developers
of phonopy under current style of phonopy development. However
useful tools should be known. If developers want to use here to notify
their tools, please contact via the phonopy mailing list.

Ascii-phonons
--------------

Ascii-phonons is a visualisation code which uses Blender (an
open-source 3D graphics package) to generate animated GIFs and static
arrow diagrams of phonon eigenmodes. These may be rendered at
publication quality. The input format is the .ascii file generated by
Phonopy when called with the --anime flag, and supercells can be used
to visualise off-gamma phonon modes.  The code is still being
developed but the core features are in place and new users are
welcome.
